# World Model Baseline

We adopt [EVAC](https://github.com/AgibotTech/EnerVerse-AC) as the baseline model for the [AgiBot World Challenge @ IROS 2025](https://agibot-world.com/challenge) - World Model track.

This repo provides a minial version of training codes. 

## News

- [2025.05.26] ðŸš€ðŸš€ The minimal version of training code for [AgiBot World Challenge @ IROS 2025](https://agibot-world.com/challenge) - World Model track have been released.

- [2025.05.26] ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ The training and validation datasets of [AgiBot World Challenge @ IROS 2025 - World Model track](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agibot-world/AgiBotWorldChallenge-2025/tree/main/WorldModel) have been released.

- [2025.05.16] The minimal version of training code for AgibotWorld dataset and pretrained weights have been released.

## Getting started

### Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/AgibotTech/AgiBotWorldChallengeIROS2025-WorldModelBaseline.git
conda create -n enerverse python=3.10.4
conda activate enerverse

pip install -r requirements.txt

### install pytorch3d following https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d
### note that although the CUDA version is 11.8, we use the pytorch3d prebuilt on CUDA 12.1
pip install --no-index --no-cache-dir pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py310_cu121_pyt240/download.html

```

### Training

#### Training on [AgiBot World Challenge @ IROS 2025](https://agibot-world.com/challenge)

1. Download [ðŸ¤—AgiBot World Challenge @ IROS 2025 - World Model track](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agibot-world/AgiBotWorldChallenge-2025/tree/main/WorldModel) dataset.

2. Download the checkpoint from [EVAC](https://huggingface.co/agibot-world/EnerVerse-AC), and modify ``model.pretrained_checkpoint`` in ``configs/agibotworld/train_config_iros_challenge_wm.yaml`` to the checkpoint file ``*.pt``

3. Download the weight of [CLIP](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K), and modify ``model.params.img_cond_stage_config.params.abspath``
in ``configs/agibotworld/train_config_iros_challenge_wm.yaml`` to the absolute path to ``open_clip_pytorch_model.bin`` inside the download directory

4. Modify the path ``data.params.train.params.data_roots`` in ``configs/agibotworld/train_config_iros_challenge_wm.yaml`` to the root of AgiBotWorld dataset

5. Run the script
```
bash scripts/train.sh configs/agibotworld/train_config_iros_challenge_wm.yaml
```

#### Training on [AgiBotWolrd](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agibot-world/AgiBotWorld-Beta)

1. Download [ðŸ¤—AgiBotWolrd](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agibot-world/AgiBotWorld-Beta) dataset.

2. Download the checkpoint from [EVAC](https://huggingface.co/agibot-world/EnerVerse-AC), and modify ``model.pretrained_checkpoint`` in ``configs/agibotworld/train_configs.yaml`` to the checkpoint file ``*.pt``

3. Download the weight of [CLIP](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K), and modify ``model.params.img_cond_stage_config.params.abspath``
in ``configs/agibotworld/train_configs.yaml`` to the absolute path to ``open_clip_pytorch_model.bin`` inside the download directory

4. Modify the path ``data.params.train.params.data_roots`` in ``configs/agibotworld/train_configs.yaml`` to the root of AgiBotWorld dataset

5. Run the script
```
bash scripts/train.sh configs/agibotworld/train_config.yaml
```
